# Summary

The UD_Italian-VIT corpus, annotated according to the UD annotation scheme, was obtained by conversion from VIT (Venice Italian Treebank), developed at the Laboratory of Computational Linguistics of the Università Ca' Foscari in Venice (Del Monte, Bristot, Tonelli, 2008).

# Introduction

    A description of the treebank and its origin (creation method, data sources, etc.)
    A description of how the data was split into training, development and test sets
    If there are multiple genres/domains, can they be told apart by sentence ids? Does the treebank consist of complete documents, or just randomly shuffled sentences?
    Acknowledgments and references that should be cited when using the treebank

... 1-2 sentences (see [release checklist](http://universaldependencies.org/release_checklist.html#the-readme-file) for README guidelines)
